# Howdy 🙋‍♀️

I'm **Neomi Margreth Inciso Mendoza**

Here's some information about me that might be relevant to you:

- 🚺 Pronouns: She/Her
- 📲 E-mail Address: `neoincisomendoza+github@gmail.com`
    > Yes, the `+github` tidbit *is* important! I modified my own webmail handler so that it filters through emails—specfically via the `+<...>` tidbit. Your e-mail will *not* be entertained if it isn't sent there (or some other valid tidbit).

Feel free to peruse my profile (I made it public, after all 😉)!
